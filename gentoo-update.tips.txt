Portage snapshot historical archives

To allow for intermediate upgrades for old systems, older snapshots are a simple way forward. In this document, a list of historical portage snapshots is maintained as well as a simple instruction set for upgrading.
Portage snapshots
Introduction

In the next table, a list of Portage snapshots is kept. Such snapshots can be used to perform intermediate upgrades.

For instance, if your system is from the beginning of the year 2009 and you notice that you canot upgrade anymore (usually because newer profiles require a recent portage that you can't install because your portage is too old). In this case, you might want to see if you can do gradual upgrades, for instance with a 6-month interval.

First download the (older) snapshot, and verify that it is not corrupt or has been tampered with. Very old snapshots will be signed with expired Gentoo Infrastructure keys but the signature itself should still be OK:

~# wget http://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/snapshots/portage-20090720.tar.bz2{,.gpgsig,.md5sum,.umd5sum}
~# gpg --verify portage-20090720.tar.bz2.gpgsig portage-20090720.tar.bz2

Extract the (older) snapshot:

~# mv /usr/portage /usr/portage.latest
~# tar xjpf portage-20090720.tar.bz2 -C /usr

Then try to upgrade important system packages (or at least Portage itself):

~# emerge -u system
~# emerge -u portage

After each try, you might be able to use the latest portage again:

~# mv /usr/portage /usr/portage.old
~# mv /usr/portage.latest /usr/portage


If not, use a somewhat more recent (but still old) portage snapshot and retry. Don't forget to switch profiles when you can, as per the Upgrading Gentoo instructions.
